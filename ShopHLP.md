<u>"SHOP  - HLP"</u>

Shop Highland Park is the first of hopefully many neighborhood / community-based apps to facilitate patronage of local small businesses by making it easier to find specific goods and services that customers want to buy.

Built on the MEAN Stack for ease of filtering and routing, Shop HLP utilizes technology frameworks such as:
<ul>
	<li>MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and NodeJS</li>
	<li>MomentJS and Angular UI Router</li>
	<li>JQuery & JQuiry UI</li>
	<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
	
To run this app, please make sure to have the most recent version of NodeJS, Express and MongoDB installed.  Clone this repository to a folder and run $npm install in your bash terminal from within the folder. Once you have confirmed that all NPM packages within the package.json file have installed enter "nodemon" into the terminal from within the parent project folder to start.
